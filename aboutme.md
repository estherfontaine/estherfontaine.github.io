title: About me
---

I am a **PhD student in applied mathematics** at the **Université de Reims Champagne-Ardenne**, affiliated with the **CReSTIC** laboratory, the **LMR**, and the **CHU de Reims**. My doctoral research, part of the **PredictAVC project**, focuses on **predicting the evolution of intracranial aneurysms using 4D flow MRI**. By combining advanced mathematical modeling and medical imaging, I aim to develop innovative tools to improve the diagnosis and management of cerebrovascular diseases.

Before starting my PhD in **October 2023**, I completed a Master’s degree in Mathematics and Applications, specializing in **Scientific Computing** at the Université de Reims Champagne-Ardenne (2021–2023). During my master’s thesis, I worked on **developing and optimizing scientific codes**, with a particular focus on **4D flow MRI for intracranial aneurysm analysis**. This experience solidified my passion for interdisciplinary research at the intersection of mathematics and medicine.

Driven by curiosity and a desire to make a tangible impact, I am committed to advancing scientific knowledge and contributing to the development of cutting-edge medical technologies.
