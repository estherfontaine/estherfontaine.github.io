# Hemodynamic Analysis of Cerebrovascular Pathologies Using 4D Flow MRI and Computational Fluid Dynamics

## Research Focus:
My research centers on the application of **4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** to investigate cerebrovascular pathologies, particularly cerebral aneurysms and vascular malformations. By integrating advanced imaging techniques with **computational modeling**, I aim to enhance the understanding of hemodynamic factors contributing to **disease progression and rupture risk**.

## Methodology:


### 4D Flow MRI:
This non-invasive imaging modality combines **three-dimensional spatial resolution with time-resolved velocity mapping**, enabling **comprehensive visualization of blood flow dynamics**. The technique facilitates the detection of hemodynamic anomalies, such as turbulent flow and stagnation zones, which are critical indicators of aneurysm instability and rupture risk.


### Image Segmentation and Processing:
I employ **MRI segmentation techniques** to extract precise vessel **geometries from 4D Flow MRI datasets**. This process involves thresholding anatomical series, computing **vessel centerlines and rays** using Vascular Modeling Toolkit (VMTK), and **generating high-fidelity meshes** for further analysis.

### Numerical Simulations:
The extracted meshes are used in **finite element method (FEM) simulations**, which are executed in parallel on supercomputers. The simulation results are then compared with 4D Flow MRI data to **validate accuracy and refine computational models**.

## Applications:

**Risk Assessment:** Evaluating the risk of aneurysm rupture through detailed hemodynamic analysis.
**Pathology Analysis:** Investigating vascular malformations, including stenoses and arteriovenous fistulas.
**Clinical Translation:** Supporting personalized treatment planning and pre-surgical evaluations by providing detailed, patient-specific hemodynamic insights.
**Impact:** This research bridges the gap between cutting-edge imaging technology and clinical practice, offering innovative approaches to diagnose, monitor, and treat cerebrovascular diseases. By providing detailed hemodynamic profiles, my work contributes to more accurate risk stratification and improved patient outcomes.
